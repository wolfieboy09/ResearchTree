# Research Tree
Needed a mod where you can add researching? Oh, how convenient!
Made this mod because I saw some factorio videos and went "huh, I should make the researching stuff in Minecraft!".

# Questions and Answers
## Will this be back-ported to 1.20.1???
**No.** I do not want to port this mod down to 1.20.1, and will be sticking with 1.21.1+ on NeoForge.
If you make a pull request with 1.20.1, and it works as intended, I will very much consider adding it as an official version.

## Will this be on (any other mod-loader than neoforge)???
**No.** I don't want to maintain a different mod-loader other than NeoForge. 
If you would like to port it to (any other mod-loader than neoforge), feel free to make a PR and I will add it as an official version.

## Can I use this in my modpack?
**Yes!**
